            <br>
            I am a curious person that is open to new possibilities and experience. Most of my hobbies are
            <br>
            Movies, Video Games, Pets, Sweets, and many more. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It was during the pandemic times that I was so confused, and I worry that I wont able to find
            <br>
            the right course for me, I was battling myself if I should be a yes man and follow what everybody
            <br>
            wants be to be like or should I be myself for once and choose my own path. And after several
            <br>
            months passed by, I finnaly accepted who I am and I should choose the path that will make me
            <br>
            happy forever, as I searched for it, I finnally discovered Computer Science, and told
            <br>
            Myself that this could be it, now I am happily taking Computer Science and hope that
            <br>
            I would graduate from this degree.
